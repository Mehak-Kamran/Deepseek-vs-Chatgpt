# Deepseek-vs-Chatgpt

Like China's Corona Virus Deepseek has also taken control over the most famous AI tool Chatgpt. On Jan,25 Deepseek has been a hot topic among Developers and every one has been talking that Chatgpt is now powerless and AI has taken AI's job(Its kinda truth)
Chatgpt uses single large Model, and when we enter a query it uses all its GPU and all its power to resolve that query and hence too much cost and time.
Where as  Deepseek uses Mixture of Expert model that divides task according to a specific query hence if asked a query it will see which domain it belongs to and then assign it to the specific expert therefore time and cost is saved
NVIDIA the most popular and largest AI hardware giant losses its 18% share , Since platforms like Microsoft and Google and openAi buy Gpu from NVIDIA.The use of mixture of expert model used by Deepseek has lower the cost of buying more and more GpuS.Deepseek uses reinforcement learning and other AI model uses finetuning. These methologies are defined as 
in finetuning it knows what it knows and in reenforcement learning it learns as it practices.
To be honest I dont think so Deepseek can take over chatgpt , I think OpenAI will give a more stronger comeback.
